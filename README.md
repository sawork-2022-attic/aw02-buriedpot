# POS in Shell

The demo shows a simple POS system with command line interface. 

To run

```shell
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

Currently, it implements three commands which you can see using the `help` command.

```shell
  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
 \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::                (v2.5.7)
 
shell:>help
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

Built-In Commands
        clear: Clear the shell screen.
        exit, quit: Exit the shell.
        help: Display help about available commands.
        history: Display or save the history of previously run commands
        script: Read and execute commands from a file.
        stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.

Pos Command
        a: Add a Product to Cart
        n: New Cart
        p: List Products
```

Everytime a customer come to make a purchase, use `n` to create a new cart and then use `a ${productid} ${amount}` to add a product to the cart.

Please make the POS system robust and fully functional by implementing more commands, for instance, print/empty/modify cart.

Implementing a PosDB with real database is very much welcome.

And please elaborate your understanding in layered systems via this homework in your README.md.



# Understanding in layered systems

A layered system means that the lower layer serves the higher layer. Each layer provides several services. Services are defined by protocols. 

Advantages:

* The programmer only needs to care about the protocols of those layers directly related to his work, which provide services to the higher layers and get services from the lower layers.
* Replaceable or updatable. The internal implementation can be changed free, as long as the external interface does not change.

* Coupling between system components is reduced.
* Good for reuse.

Disadvantages:

* Performance problems. A simple operation made by the highest layer may be transferred layer by layer to the lowest layer, which may cause performance degradation.
